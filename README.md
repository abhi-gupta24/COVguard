## ðŸ”˜ Features
- Body temperature should be between 35 - 39-degree Celsius to pass the scan. 

- You need to stand between 35-60 cm from the camera to scan your face and to a maintain safe distance.

- You need to pass the threshold value, which is 80% of your face covered to pass the scan.

- There is also a pushbutton to open the door manually from inside.
